# Content Analysis Section Enhancement

## Overview
Updated the content analysis section to show which specific frameworks were considered instead of generic counts, and made individual framework recommendations more prominent.

## Changes Made

### 1. LLMAssessmentPanel Component (`components/LLMAssessmentPanel.tsx`)

#### New Features Added:
- **Framework Summary at Top**: Added a visual summary showing all frameworks analyzed with individual badges
- **Framework Analysis Summary Section**: Added a comprehensive grid showing each framework's statistics:
  - Issues found per framework
  - Suggestions provided per framework
  - Whether rewrites are available
- **Enhanced Question Display**: Individual framework badges for each question instead of generic counts
- **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Better organization and styling of framework information

#### Visual Improvements:
- Framework names displayed as individual badges instead of "X frameworks"
- Color-coded statistics (red for issues, green for suggestions, blue for rewrites)
- Better borders and spacing for improved readability
- Renamed "Suggestions" to "Recommendations" for clarity
- Renamed "Rewritten Question" to "Optimized Question"

### 2. Toast Notifications (`pages/index.tsx`)

#### Updates:
- **Basic Assessment**: Changed from "multiple frameworks" to "PAS, Fogg, Nielsen, AIDA, and Cialdini frameworks"
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Shows all 9 frameworks explicitly: "PAS, Fogg, Nielsen, AIDA, Cialdini, SCARF, JTBD, TOTE, ELM"

## Framework Coverage

### Basic Assessment (5 frameworks):
- **PAS**: Problem-Agitation-Solution
- **Fogg**: Fogg Behavior Model
- **Nielsen**: Nielsen's Usability Heuristics  
- **AIDA**: Attention-Interest-Desire-Action
- **Cialdini**: Cialdini's Persuasion Principles

### Enhanced Analysis (9 frameworks):
All of the above plus:
- **SCARF**: Status-Certainty-Autonomy-Relatedness-Fairness
- **JTBD**: Jobs To Be Done
- **TOTE**: Test-Operate-Test-Exit
- **ELM**: Elaboration Likelihood Model

## User Benefits

1. **Clear Framework Visibility**: Users can immediately see which frameworks were used in analysis
2. **Individual Framework Insights**: Each framework's specific contributions are highlighted
3. **Better Decision Making**: Framework-specific statistics help prioritize improvements
4. **Improved UX**: More informative and visually appealing presentation of analysis results

## Technical Implementation

- Uses existing data structures (`LLMAssessmentResult` interface)
- Backward compatible with existing API responses
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing
- Maintains existing expand/collapse functionality for detailed views
